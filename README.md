markov
======

A simple command-line program designed to generate words using Markov chains.
The idea for this project belongs to leb2, and the 'words' file is from /usr/share/dict/words on my Mac OSX install.

To run the program, simply type `markov`. For fun (on Mac OSX), type in `watch 'markov | say'` and be amused by a new word every 2 seconds.

FEATURES (upcoming):

Will have an "end of word" character, making lengths not required.
For known files, will read/write frequency files making chain generation faster.
